Initial commit of sample code to GitHub

##Dec 21 2014
On the first day of #Commitmas my patience gave to me, installing git on Windows and cloning this repos-i-tory

##Dec 22 2014
2nd edit, setup additional systems to access account

##Dec 25 2014
A Commitmas miracle, 5 straight days of doing something on GitHub, and not having to look up the commands to make it happen!

##Dec 26 2014
Added web-build.yml example. Explored git commit --amend with errors in initial example.

Honing my markdown skills by:

* Adding headers
+ Adding lists
- Using either *, +, or -

---
Also looking at numbered lists

1. Sequential numbers
2. Such as 1., 2., etc...
8. Work the same as numbers
22. In any order
42. For example the list you are reading here - 1., 2., 3., 4., 5. are actually numbered 1.,2.,8.,22.,42.!

***

		Indenting twice will set text as a code block

        Or Indenting 4x spaces twice

	    Or a combination of 1x indent and 4x spaces

Commitmas commit time

##Dec 31 2014
Happy New Years! Don't worry, I've not missed my 12 days of Commitmas, I spent a couple of days commiting to a branch of the Ansible to update the documentation as I thought it needed a couple of tweaks.

Hello 2015! Thank you to mjbrender for organizing Commitmas. GitHub was something I really didn't get before and now I at least have a basic understanding. Stay tuned for more GitHub goodness!
